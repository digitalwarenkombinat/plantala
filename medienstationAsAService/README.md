# Media station as a Service (MaaS)

The _Media station as a Service_ (MaaS) offers a simple and user-friendly way to create a media station by combining the power of Plantala with your own images. Semi-automated processes allow you to integrate your data and customize the media station without deep technical knowledge.
## Features

âœ… Create your own media station in just 3 simple steps.

âœ… Automatic image import and background removal.

âœ… Edit and add background information for your media content.

âœ… Automatic color scheme based on your starting image.

âœ… Customizable color themes for the media station.

âœ… Display information with a clean and visually appealing design.

# TL;DR

    ðŸš€ Step 1: Copy your images to the `public/images/input` folder, and add a logo (`public/images/logo.png`) and a starting image (`public/images/start.png`).

    ðŸš€ Step 2: Start the media station with `docker-compose up -d --build`.

    ðŸš€Step 3: Generate media data with `docker exec -d plantala-app npm run media-data`, then edit public/mediaData.js for background info and color customization.

# Creating Your Own Media Station in 3 Simple Steps

You can create your own media station in three easy steps.

1. Copy Your Images
2. Start the Media Station
3. Customize Your Media Data & Color Scheme

---

## Step 1: Copy Your Images ðŸŽ¨

First, copy all the images you want to use to the `public/images/input` folder. These images will automatically have their backgrounds removed when you start the media station.

Guidelines for Images:

    For best results, each image should contain a single object on a solid background.
    The filename of each image will be used as the title in the media station, so name your files accordingly.

Additionally, youâ€™ll need a logo and a starting image. These should be placed directly in the `public/images` folder:

    logo.png: Your logo for the media station.
    start.png: The starting image, which will be used to generate the color scheme.

## Step 2: Start the Media Station ðŸš€

To run your media station, you'll need _Docker_, which is a tool that lets you run applications in isolated environments called containers.

Steps to Install and Start _Docker_:

1. Install _Docker_: Follow the instructions at [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

2. Start the media station: Once _Docker_ is installed, open your terminal and run:

```
    docker-compose up -d --build
```

This command will start two services:

1. plantala-media-data: Automatically removes the backgrounds from your images.
2. plantala-app: Hosts the media station, accessible at http://localhost:3000/.

Your media station is now live, but there's one more step to finalize it.

## Step 3: Add Background Information & Customize the Color Scheme ðŸŽ¨

After the background removal process, your images will be placed in the public/images folder (alongside logo.png and start.png). Now, itâ€™s time to display them in the media station and customize the color scheme.

Generate Media Data:

Run the following command in your terminal to generate the media data for your station:

```
docker exec -d plantala-app npm run media-data
```

After this, open the media station again [with this link](http://localhost:3000/), and you should see all your images.

Customizing the Color Scheme:

The media stationâ€™s color scheme is automatically derived from the starting image (start.png), but you can further customize it. The generated media data is saved in _public/mediaData.js_, which includes colors based on the starting image.
Example Color Configuration:

```
const primaryColor = '#799160';     // Primary color
const secondaryColor = '#e0bf96';   // Secondary color
const backgroundColor = '#faebd7';  // Background color
const textColor = '#341419';        // Text color
const errorColor = '#f3aa1e';       // Error message color
const infoColor = '#ab465a';        // Info message color
const successColor = '#f3aa1e';     // Success message color
```

You can customize these colors using any hex color value. For easy color selection, use the [Colordot website](https://color.hailpixel.com/)..
Additional Customization:

In public/mediaData.js, you can also update the following details for each image:

    _name_: Title of the image (derived from the file name).
    _source_: The file path to the clipped image.
    _description_: A short description of the image.
    _link_: An optional external link (e.g., a reference to the original content).
    _wiki_: An optional link to Wikipedia or similar resources.

Any changes you make will be immediately visible in the media station after refreshing the page.

# You're Done! Your Media Station Is Ready ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations! Your media station is now live, and you can access it [here](http://localhost:3000/).

Exporting the Media Station:

If you want to share or deploy your media station, you can export it with this command:

```
docker exec -d plantala-app npm run build
```

This will create two versions:

1. A Node.js-supported production application in the .next folder for hosting on your server.
2. A static HTML version in the out folder, which can be hosted without a Node.js server.

Stopping the Media Station:

When you're done, you can stop the media station using:

```
docker-compose stop
```

Enjoy your media station!
